i believe  you are incorrect in stating on #countryfile just now. the peak district national park  is the oldest, not the lakes @benfogle
@benfogle @itvcountrywise @ntscafellpike @ordnancesurvey @itv and also rewrite history peak district is the oldest national park
@bbc ben fogle has just claimed the lake district is britain's oldest national park. it isn't! the peak district was the 1st in 1951
