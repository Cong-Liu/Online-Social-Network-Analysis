1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?
It misleads to compare the total numbers of the two users. E.g. user A and B
both have less than 20 followers while they have 10 friend_overlap, user C and
D have 100 friend_overlap but each of them has more than 10,000 followers. In
this case, we can easily figure out that A and B are more similar than C and D
even A/B pairs has less friend_overlap than C/D pairs.

An easy way to fix this issue is that not only compare the number of overlaps but
also compare the percentage of overlaps among total friends.


2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

The user followed by both Clinton and Trump is 'MagicJohnson'. According to Wikipidia,
"Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. was an famous basketball player who played for the Los
Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 13 seasons." Johnson's top
seasons were 1980s to 1990s, maybe at that time Clinton and Trump were both interested in
NBA and were funs of Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson also famous for his HIV activism.
Johnson also supports for Clinton on 2016 presidential campaign, while shows friendship
with Trump. That may be another point for why he is followed by both Hillary and Donald.


3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

I think it might be affected by their personalities. Donald is an arrogant person,
who don't like to listen and follow others' thoughts. While Gary might be nicer and
 more friendly, who like to be friends with others and enjoy more socials.

For Donald Trump, it could be easier for us to find who he trusts with and has closer
connections than others. For Gary Johnson, it would be harder to to this analysis.



4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Friends per candidate:
DrJillStein 4155
GovGaryJohnson 3123
HillaryClinton 748
realDonaldTrump 42
Most common friends:
[(15846407, 3), (19608297, 3), (41877508, 2), (12, 2), (65404941, 2)]
Friend Overlap:
[('DrJillStein', 'GovGaryJohnson', 349), ('GovGaryJohnson', 'realDonaldTrump', 12), 
('DrJillStein', 'HillaryClinton', 10), ('GovGaryJohnson', 'HillaryClinton', 9), 
('DrJillStein', 'realDonaldTrump', 8), ('HillaryClinton', 'realDonaldTrump', 1)]

After caculate the total number of friends for all the cadidates, there are 4155+3123+748+42-349-12-10-9-8-1+2=7681
So for 7861 ids, we have to make ceiling(7681/15) = 513 requests.
The TwitterAPI allows 15 requests per 15 minutes, ,it needs (513-1)*15+1 = 7681 minutes
